# C# Coding Guidelines

This style guide is intended both for code developed internally at Straitjacket Software and for contributors to our open source codebases. It makes stylistic choices
based on Microsoft's .NET [Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/), with the objective of writing maintainable,
readable and scalable code while following modern best practices.
