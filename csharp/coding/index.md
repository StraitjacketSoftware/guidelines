# C# Coding Guidelines

This style guide is intended both for code developed internally at Straitjacket Software and for contributors to our open source codebases.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

It makes stylistic choices based on Microsoft's .NET [Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/), with the objective
of writing maintainable, readable and scalable code, while taking advantage of modern C# language features and best practices.
